# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-MODEL
🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning This project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression models to predict house prices based on property features (like area, rooms, and location). It includes EDA 📊, model training 🤖

🚀 Highlights

🔎 EDA: Outliers, correlations, distributions, missing values

🧱 Feature Engineering: Encoding, scaling, transformations, domain features

🎯 Evaluation: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² + cross-validation

📊 Visuals: Feature importance, residual plots, learning curves
